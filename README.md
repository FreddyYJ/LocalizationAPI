# LocalizationAPI
LocalizationAPI is Minecraft Spigot plugin for player localization. It supports translation by using language files.

Current version is 0.1.0.

I need lots of test, feedbacks and reports. Please comment at plugin page, or Github issue.

# How to install
Installation of this plugin is same as other plugins. But, it needs default language file called 'en_us.json'.
1. Create en_us.json with key text and value text. For example,
 ```{
        "message1":"Hello",
        "message2":"World!",
        ...
    }```
2. Add this file at (your server directory)/plugin/LocalizationAPI/lang.
