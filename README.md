# LocalizationAPI
LocalizationAPI is Minecraft Spigot plugin for player localization. It supports translation by using language files.

Current version is 0.2.0.

I need lots of test, feedbacks and reports. Please comment at plugin page, or Github issue.

## How to install
Installation of this plugin is same as other plugins. But, it needs default language file called 'en_us.json'.
1. install .jar file under plugins folder.
2. Run server.
3. Stop server, and ``` en_us.json ``` will be created in plugins/LocalizationAPI/lang.
4. Add your custom translations in ``` en_us.json ```.
5. Run server again, and enjoy!
